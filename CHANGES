   will now be ordered to match the original input scenario.yml. (CID-3993)

   coded value (CID-4250)

 * The playbook directive in Execute was not properly passing the playbook to
   ansible causing failures. (CID-4253)

 * When using JSONPath expression in the Execute command directive, carbon was
   mistakenly processing like its data pass-through meta characters. (CID-4293)

 * Due to some dependency issues with Linchpin and Ansible. Pinned the Ansible
   version to 2.7.9 until the Linchpin bug with Ansible 2.8 is resolved. Added and

   by taking out in the CCIT polarion importer library, Polar.
   Upgrade to Polar 1.1.1 
   https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccit/ccit-report-tools/polar

 * Resolve an issue where the xUnit Importer would state the 
   import was succesful but failed to generate a UMB Message
   so the CCIT polarion importer library would fail the import
   since it couldn't parse a message. Updated to Polar 1.1.1

 * Modified carbon's setup file to include the following packages 
   in install_requires paramiko 2.4.2, ansible >= 2.7, 
   and requests>=2.20.1

   import the results to the xUnit importer and monitor for
   import completion 


Version 1.0.7 (2019-04-01)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* A regression in python 3 support when provisioning Beaker resources using a
  kickstart file. Spaces were inadvertently being removed when generating the
  beaker job xml causing the kickstart file unparseable.

* When provisioning OpenStack resources if a VM went into an error state it
  would sit and loop until the provisioning timeout

* When using the ansible Become options to raise user privileges during the
  execute phase, a failure would occur during the artifact step because
  the escalated user was not being used.

* When VM/resource ip is not reachable or wrong authentication key is provided
  carbon exited without proper exception message

Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for ansible --skip-tags options that can be used in the ansible
  orchestrator by specifying the ansible option skip_tags and providing a
  list of tags.

* Support for defining a static inventory file directory in the carbon.cfg
  that can be used by the orchestration and execute phase to store the
  ansible inventory files.


Version 1.0.6 (2019-03-6)
--------------------------

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Modified the execute phase so that shell/script results.txt output generated
  is text wrapped and dedented before parsing the results

* A regression in python 3 exception handling was throwing another exception that
  the exception could not be parsed.

* The Beaker hostname is correctly save to the Provider hostname key during provision
  phase so that it correlates with the hostname folder created during the artifact
  step in the execute phase

* Modified artifact step so as to not collect artifacts during an exception
  handling if a user has not specified any artifacts.

* Modified artifact step so as to not collect artifacts during an exception
  handling when it happens during the git or artifact step.

Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for assigning multiple roles to a host in the Provision phase.

* No longer fail in the execute phase when gathering an artifact that doesn't exist.
  Now log which were successfully collected, which were skipped due to not existing,
  and which failed due to external reasons.

* Strip all carriage returns when processing script or shell command output in the
  execute phase.

* Anisble verbosity will always default to a single (-v) and can now be
  configured to any ansible supported level in the carbon.cfg file independent of
  carbon log level.

* If a cleanup task is specified for a run and carbon fails at some point before
  that cleanup task is launched, carbon will launch the cleanup task so
  as to not leave stale resources behind.

Enhancement
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added to Beaker Credentials the optional parameter, ca_path, to allow a user to
  specify a path to a trusted CA file.

* Added to Beaker support for the host_requires_option, force=<FQDN>, to facilitate
